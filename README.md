# ios2
Some code from [Perry](https://github.com/perryprog) and I to test fading sound in and out.

A video of what it currently looks like is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cyo72smb4ji9a0v/IMG_1720.m4v?dl=0).

I called this repo **ios2** because I wasn't able to push to the new [**ios**](https://github.com/germantownacademySOS/ios) repo - have some permissions issues we need to work out with Charlie.
